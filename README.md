# Scholarships-Flutter-Application
This is my fourth-year semester project, I tried to simulate a scholarship system where I host both universities and students, so with some restrictions provided by the universities for their scholarships, the system links the appropriate student with the appropriate scholarship, and gives him an acceptance percentage in each scholarship he wants.
It was my first project to start learning Flutter development.
