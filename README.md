# Scholarships-Flutter-Application
This is my fourth-year semester project, I tried to simulate a system that hosts both universities and students, so with some restrictions provided by the universities for their scholarships, the system links the appropriate student with the appropriate scholarship, and gives him an acceptance percentage for each scholarship he wants.
It was my first project to start learning Flutter development.
