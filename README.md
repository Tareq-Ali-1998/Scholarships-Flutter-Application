# Scholarships-Flutter-Application
This is my fourth-year semester project, I tried to simulate a system that hosts both universities and students, so with some restrictions provided by the universities for their scholarships, the system links the appropriate student with the appropriate scholarship, and gives him the percentage of acceptance for each scholarship he wants.

This was my first project to start learning Flutter development.

# Notes
More information will be here soon about the documentation and many details.
